    Tracks PCF data exchange requests and responses.

    This entity stores metadata about PCF exchanges, including the requesting
    and responding BPNs, part identifiers, and exchange status. The actual
    PCF payload is stored in the submodel service or referenced by location.

    Attributes:
        id: Primary key.
        request_id: Unique identifier for the PCF request (UUID).
        created_at: Timestamp when the exchange was initiated.
        updated_at: Timestamp of the last status update.
        direction: Whether this is an incoming or outgoing exchange.
        status: Current status of the exchange.
        requesting_bpn: BPN of the party requesting PCF data.
        responding_bpn: BPN of the party providing PCF data (if known).
        manufacturer_part_id: Manufacturer's part identifier.
        customer_part_id: Customer's part identifier (optional).
        message: Optional message associated with the exchange.
        pcf_location: URI/path where the PCF data payload is stored.
        correlation_id: Optional ID to correlate with external systems.
